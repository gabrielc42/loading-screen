      <h3> The Princess: Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal </h3>

      Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white; <br>

      Nor waves the cypress in the palace walk; <br>

      Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font. <br>

      The firefly wakens; waken thou with me. <br>

      Now droops the milk-white peacock like a ghost, <br>

      And like a ghost she glimmers on to me. <br>

      Now lies the Earth all DanaÃ« to the stars, <br>

      And all thy heart lies open unto me. <br>

      Now slides the silent meteor on, and leaves <br>

      A shining furrow, as thy thoughts in me. <br>

      Now folds the lily all her sweetness up, <br>

      And slips into the bosom of the lake. <br>

      So fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip <br>

      Into my bosom and be lost in me. <br>
